<lg><l>How wonderful are Dreams! Yet, are they but</l>
<l>(As some suppose) the thin disjoining shades</l>
<l>Of facts and feelings long foregone or late,</l>
<l>As <del>gathered</del> <add>recomposed</add>, and <del>disposed</del> <add>put</add> in ghostly act</l>
<l>And strange procession, wildly mixed, and yet</l>
<l>So life-like, though thus composite and wild,</l>
<l>By wakeful Fancy,&#x2014;<del>in her mimic mood</del> <add>when alone awake</add>,</l>
<l><add>And thence unhindered in her mimic craft,</add></l>
<l><del>Tracking</del> <add>She tracks</add> the vaguer drifts of wearied Thought,</l>
<l>Itself sunk sleepward? Wonderful no less</l>
<l>Are they though this be true; and wondrous more</l>
<l>Is she who in the dark, and stripped of sense,</l>
<l>Can claim such sovereignty&#x2014;the Queen of Art!</l>
<l>For what a cunning painter is she then,</l>
<l>And sculptor, who, in bodying from the waste</l>
<l>Of things memorial littering life's dim floor,</l>
<l>The forms and features manifold and quaint</l>
<l>That crowd the timeless vistas of a Dream,</l>

<pb n="151" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/155"/>

<l>Fails never in a stroke, and breathes as well</l>
<l>A spirit of motion into all her work&#x2014;</l>
<l>The test of deity;&#x2014;inspiring too</l>
<l>Her phantom creatures with more eloquent tones</l>
<l>Than ever broke in subtle waves, like light,</l>
<l>Upon a waking ear?</l></lg>

<lg><l type="F">But are they more?</l>
<l>Sure glimpses oft, though vague, of some wide sea</l>
<l>Of mystic being, on whose lonely shore</l>
<l>Things mortal terminate; and where the pent</l>
<l>Impatient Soul<del>,</del> from its sleep-shrouded crib</l>
<l>Slipping sometimes, is wont to roam at large,</l>
<l>Like Crusoe, staring forth; or musing stand</l>
<l>As once the intelligence of Newton stood</l>
<l>Upon the shores of Time, while the great deep</l>
<l>Of Nature, yet untried, around it loomed</l>
<l><add>Under <del>heaven's</del> <add>the</add> incommunicable <del>dome,</del> sky</add></l>
<l>Illimitably out.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="F">But vain is all</l>
<l>Conjecture: they are Dreams! and wonderful,</l>
<l>However we may rank them in our lore.</l>
<l>And worthy well <del>a</del> <add>some</add> passing thought are <del>things</del> states</l>
<l>Of our interior being, though aberrant,</l>

<pb n="152" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/156"/>

<l>That with a wand so capable can bring</l>
<l>Back to the faded heart<del>,</del> the rosy flush</l>
<l>And sweetness of a long fled love, or touch</l>
<l>The eyes of an old enmity with tears</l>
<l>Of a yet older friendship; or restore</l>
<l>A world-lost mate, or reunite in joy</l>
<l>The living and the dead! Yet this can Dreams:</l>
<l>And more as wonderful;&#x2014;can, when so wills</l>
<l>Their wand's weird wielder, whatsoe'er it be,</l>
<l>Lift up the fall&#x00EB;n&#x2014;fall'n however low!</l>
<l>Rejuvenate the worn; enrich the poor;</l>
<l>The past imparadise, and enchant the present;</l>
<l>Build in the future higher than the hope</l>
<l>Of Power, when boldest, ever dared to soar;</l>
<l>Annul<del>,</del> as with the sanction of the Infinite,</l>
<l>The prison bars of place, the dens of time,&#x2014;</l>
<l>Giving the rigid and dull-clanking chain</l>
<l>Which Force, that grey iniquity, hath clenched</l>
<l>About its captive, to relent,&#x2014;yea, stretch</l>
<l>Out into Fairy-land; or melt like wax</l>
<l>In that fierce life <del>which</del> <add>whose spirit</add> lightens wide <del>around</del></l>
<l>Round Freedom<del>,</del> seated on his mountain throne!</l>
<l>Or witching Memory, where she darkling lies,</l>
<l>Can so accomplish her<del>,</del> that she can make</l>

<pb n="153" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/157"/>

<l>All brute bulk ocular,<add>&#x2014;the great earth itself</add> <del>and</del> <add>or</add> spread her wings</l>
<l><add>Diaphanous, like a mighty globe of glass</add></l>
<l><del>O'er a whole life time</del> <add>Hung in the void of time</add>&#x2014;as from east to west</l>
<l><add>Over all ages</add></l>
<l>Evolve at once the wings of morn, and show</l>
<l>All things beneath them in one world-wide act,</l>
<l>Instant and universal!&#x2014;Wonderful!</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">But not thus always are our dreams benign:</l>
<l>Oft are they miscreations&#x2014;gloomier worlds</l>
<l>Crowded tempestuously with Wrongs and Fears</l>
<l>More ghastly than the Actual ever knew;</l>
<l>And rent with racking noises, such as might</l>
<l>If audible ever to a soul awake,</l>
<l>Go thundering only through the wastes of Hell!</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">So wonderful are Dreams: and I have <del>had</del> <add>known</add></l>
<l>Many most wild and strange. And once, long since,</l>
<l>As in the death-like mystery of Sleep</l>
<l>My body lay impalled, my soul arose</l>
<l>And journeyed outward in a dream of wonder.&#x2014;</l>
<l>In the mid hour of a dark night, methought</l>
<l>I roamed the margin of a waveless Lake,</l>
<l>Which, in the knotted forehead of the land</l>
<l>Deep sunken, like a huge <del>Cyclopic</del> <add>Cyclopean</add> eye,</l>
<l>Lidless, and void of speculation, stared</l>

<pb n="154" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/158"/>

<l>Glassily up,&#x2014;for ever sleepless,&#x2014;up</l>
<l>At the wide vault of heaven; and that I had</l>
<l>Also a vague and mystic consciousness</l>
<l>That over against me, on the farther shore,</l>
<l>Which yet I might not see, there stood a Tower</l>
<l>Such as we read of in some old romance.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">The darkness darkened, until overhead</l>
<l>Solidly black the starless heaven domed,</l>
<l>And earth was one wide blot&#x2014;when, as I looked,</l>
<l>Suddenly lamping through the hollow dark</l>
<l>A Light swung blazing from the unseen Tower,</l>
<l>(Unseen, though prophesied in imagination)</l>
<l>And brought at once its rounded structure forth</l>
<l>Out of the mighty gloom, wherein, till then,</l>
<l>So shut it seemed as one in substance with it.</l>
<l>And when the Light had steadied, hanging there</l>
<l>Against the grim front of the night-backed Tower,</l>
<l>Suspended as by magic, I might see</l>
<l>In the wide Lake whose whole disc now between</l>
<l>Glimmered though dubiously, the falling stream</l>
<l>Of its wild radiance, columnar and vast,</l>
<l>Reach quivering,&#x2014;down, like a great shaft of fire,</l>
<l>Through the lit waters.</l></lg>

<pb n="155" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/159"/>

<lg><l type="F">Long in stedfast wonder</l>
<l>It held me gazing,&#x2014;till I thence could feel</l>
<l>A strange and thrillingly attractive power</l>
<l>In gradual operation; and ere long,</l>
<l>My bodily weight seemed witched away, and up</l>
<l>I mounted, poised within the passive air;</l>
<l>Then glode ascendingly sheer o'er the Lake,</l>
<l>Which, far below, as tow'rds the wondrous <emph><hi rend="ul">light</hi></emph></l>
<l>The attraction drew me, I beheld illumed</l>
<l>Even to its sullen depths with shifting beams,</l>
<l>That tangled Tower-ward into one broad path</l>
<l>Of multifarious splendor,&#x2014;<emph><hi rend="ul">one</hi></emph> red blaze,</l>
<l>Yet various, wildly interwrithing quick,</l>
<l>As every molecule of the watery mass</l>
<l>Had an organic life, and played a part</l>
<l>Restlessly proper to its wayward self,</l>
<l>Though tending all into one glow of bright</l>
<l>Disunion in bright union.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="F">On I slid:</l>
<l>Nor knew I why&#x2014;but my amaze wore off</l>
<l>As thus I glode over the Lake, and still</l>
<l>Approached the Tower and that so wondrous <emph><hi rend="ul">light</hi></emph>!</l>
<l>And soon, instead, a many-branching warmth,</l>

<pb n="156" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/160"/>

<l>Even like the spirit of new love, began</l>
<l>To tingle in my being: and with this</l>
<l>So sweet conception,&#x2014;lo, a beauteous change!</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">Within a circular balcony, whose roof</l>
<l>Was fluted silver, lightly propt on four</l>
<l>Pencil-like shafts of jet, <del>whose</del> <add>the</add> polished lines [<add>rules</add>]</l>
<l><add>Of which</add> Descending to an ivory <del>balustrade</del> <add>rail</add>,</l>
<l>Glistened in contrast with a covert gleam;</l>
<l>And which, high up the Tower, emporched a huge</l>
<l>And brazen dore,&#x2014;behold, a Lady, all</l>
<l>Of light immaculate&#x2014;yea, face and form</l>
<l>All of a Hesper radi<del>e</del><add>a</add>ncy composed,</l>
<l>And lovelier than lustrous, stood alone,</l>
<l>Yet, as it seemed, expectant; for as still</l>
<l>She witched me tow'ards her <del>there</del>, she <add>kept</add> beckoned me</l>
<l>With tiny hand more splendid than a star:</l>
<l><del>Beckoned and smiled</del> <add>Beckoning and <emph><hi rend="ul">smiling</hi></emph></add>,&#x2014;not as <del>mere</del> mortals use,</l>
<l>With risible throes, local and weak at most,&#x2014;</l>
<l>But with her whole bright influence all at once</l>
<l>In gracious act; as smiles the Morning, when</l>
<l>Its subtle lips in rosy glory part</l>
<l>And <del>redden</del> lengthwise redden, under and above</l>
<l>The pearly clouds;&#x2014;and with a voice intense</l>

<pb n="157" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/161"/>

<l>And intimately tender as the first</l>
<l>Fine feeling of a love-born bliss, and oh!</l>
<l>More silvery in its sweetness to the ear's</l>
<l>Internal test, than seemeth to the eye</l>
<l>The wild white radiance of the maiden Moon,</l>
<l>When from some <del>promontory looking forth</del> <add>cape's dark beak her rising mass</add></l>
<l><del>Over</del> <add>O'erlooks</add> the ocean,&#x2014;even with such a voice,</l>
<l>So keen, so silvery, she kept asking aye</l>
<l>"Where hast thou stayed so long?"</l></lg>

<lg><l type="F">I heard&#x2014;but felt</l>
<l>Pass from me forth a cry of instant fear,</l>
<l>As swooning through intensity of joy,</l>
<l>Methought I drifted&#x2014;whither? All was now</l>
<l>One wide cold blank&#x2014;the Lady and the Tower,</l>
<l>The gleaming Lake, <del>and</del> <add>with</add> all around it&#x2014;one</l>
<l>Wide dreary blank, the drearier for that still</l>
<l>A dizzy, clinging, ghostly consciousness</l>
<l>Kept glimmering from mine inmost pulse of life,</l>
<l>Like a far meteor in some dismal marsh:</l>
<l>How long I dreamt not&#x2014;but the thrilling warmth</l>
<l>Which, like the new birth of a passionate bliss,</l>
<l>Erewhile had searched me to the quick, again</l>
<l>Shuddered within me,&#x2014;more and more, until</l>

<pb n="158" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/162"/>

<l>Mine eyes had opened under <emph><hi rend="ul">two</hi></emph> that made</l>
<l>All else like darkness; and upon my cheek</l>
<l>A breath that seemed the final spirit of health</l>
<l>And Floral sweetness, harbingered more near</l>
<l>The fond enquiry of that silver voice</l>
<l>Which once to have heard was never to forget:</l>
<l>"Where hast thou stayed so long?"</l></lg>

<lg><l type="F">And when she thus</l>
<l>Had spoken, there came warbled, as it seemed</l>
<l>In <del>sweet[?]</del> <add>mystical</add> respondence to her voice,</l>
<l>Still music, such as Eolus gives forth,</l>
<l>But purer, deeper;&#x2014;warbled as from some</l>
<l>Unsearchable recess of soul supreme&#x2014;</l>
<l>Some depth of the Eternal! echoing thence</l>
<l>Through the sweet meaning of its spirit-speech,</l>
<l>The fond enquiry that awoke me now:</l>
<l>"Where hast thou stayed so long?"</l></lg>

<lg><l type="F">I answered not,</l>
<l>But followed in mute love her eyes with mine,</l>
<l>As in that balcony which up the Tower</l>
<l>Emporched the brazen door, methought I now</l>
<l>Close at her side reclined upon a couch</l>

<pb n="159" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/163"/>

<l>Of purple, blazoned all with stars of gold</l>
<l>Tremblingly rayed with spiculated gems,</l>
<l>And argent moons,&#x2014;and bearing cushions, rough</l>
<l>With sheaves of flowers in glowing tissue wrought.</l>
<l>Thus sat we, looking forth: nor did I marvel</l>
<l>As hers now led my vision, to remark</l>
<l>That the broad Lake, with its green shelving shores</l>
<l>Swarming with flowers, <del>and</del> <add>or</add> draped with vines, and thence</l>
<l>The prospect all&#x2014;hills, skies, and winding vales,</l>
<l>And bloomy forests of unspeakable beauty,</l>
<l>Were basking in the <del>radiance</del> <add>blessedness</add> of a day</l>
<l><del>More blessedly</del> <add>So goldenly</add> serene<del>, than ever</del> <add>that never</add> yet</l>
<l><add>The perfect power of life-essential light</add></l>
<l>Might so enrobe the common world of man</l>
<l>Since Paradise was lost.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="F">I saw all this</l>
<l>Surpassing beauty&#x2014;but I saw it thus</l>
<l>Through her superior life, her moon-like sphere</l>
<l>Of being, that seemed the inexhaustible source</l>
<l>(Transpicuously evinced) of breathing thoughts&#x2014;</l>
<l>Breathing abroad like <del>fragrance</del> <add>odors</add> from a flower;</l>
<l>And effluent idealities; and more</l>
<l>Of rosy passion and affectionate joy,</l>
<l>And earnest tenderness, than many souls</l>

<pb n="160" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/164"/>

<l>Of Earth's most fervent and ecstatic daughters</l>
<l>United might possess;&#x2014;all interflowing</l>
<l>Through the fine issues of a love at once</l>
<l>Wilful and nice,&#x2014;but sanctioned none the less</l>
<l>By its so brilliant pur<del>e</del><add>i</add>ty. Nor might</l>
<l>The glassy Lake below <del>receive the print</del> <add>more quickly give</add></l>
<l>Nimble impressions of the coming wind's</l>
<l>Invisible footsteps, dimpling swift along,</l>
<l>Than instant tokens of communion sweet</l>
<l>With outward beauty's subtle spirit, passed</l>
<l>Forth from her eyes, and thence in lambent waves</l>
<l>Suffused and lightened o'er the splendid whole</l>
<l>Of her bright visage, or about her head</l>
<l>In spheres ran raying like a glory of bliss!</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">But as upon the wonder of her beauty</l>
<l>My soul now feasted, even till it seemed</l>
<l>Instinct with kindred lustre,&#x2014;lo, her eyes</l>
<l>Suddenly saddened, and abstractedly</l>
<l>Outfixing them as on some far wild thought</l>
<l>That darkened up <del>over our peace</del> <add>like a portentous cloud</add></l>
<l><add>Over the morning of our peace</add>, she flung</l>
<l>Her silver voice into a mystic song</l>
<l>Of many measures, gathering as they went,</l>
<l>And sliding on&#x2014;a sweet abundant flood</l>

<pb n="161" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/165"/>

<l>Of metric melody! With which, as still</l>
<l>She poured it forth, invisible Singers mixed</l>
<l>A choral burthen that prolonged the strain's</l>
<l>Rich concords, till the echoes of the hills</l>
<l>Came forth in turn, and, flowing off<del>,</del> afar,</l>
<l>Blent all into <emph><hi rend="ul">one</hi></emph> mystery of sound&#x2014;</l>
<l><emph><hi rend="ul">One</hi></emph> manifold cadence&#x2014;dying down. The Song</l>
<l>(Which strangely seemed through all its mystic drift</l>
<l>Addressed to the so stubborn fact<del>,</del> that I</l>
<l>Was sleeping, and its utterer but a Dream!)</l>
<l>Is traced upon the tablet of my soul</l>
<l>In shining lines that intonate themselves&#x2014;</l>
<l>Not sounding to the ear, but to the thought</l>
<l>Out of the vague vast of the Wonderful!</l>
<l>And might, when hardened into normal speech,</l> 
<l>And narrowed from its wide and various sweep</l>
<l>Into such flows as make our waking rhymes</l>
<l>Most wildly musical, be written thus:</l></lg>

<lg>

<head>The Song.</head>

<lg><l rend="indent1">Wide apart&#x2014;wide apart</l>
<l rend="indent1">In old Time's dim heart,</l>
<l>One terrible Fiend doth his grim watch keep</l>

<lg><l rend="indent1">Could we disarm him&#x2014;</l>
<l rend="indent1">Could we but charm him,</l>

<lg><l>She ceased: and a deep tingled silence fell</l>
<l><del>Into[?]</del> Instantly round;&#x2014;silence complete, and yet</l>
<l>Instinct as with a breathing sweetness, left</l>

<pb n="164" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/168"/>

<l>Her bright face tow'rds me<del>,</del> as I stood entranced,</l>
<l>Yet with keen wonder stung, she said:</l></lg>

<lg><l type="F">"I love thee,</l>
<l>As first love loveth&#x2014;utterly! But ah,</l>
<l>This Love itself&#x2014;this purpled-wing&#x00EB;d Love&#x2014;</l>
<l>This spirit-sweetening Spirit of delight,</l>
<l>Is but a honey-bee of Paradise,</l>
<l>That only in its morning glory dares</l>
<l>To range abroad&#x2014;and when a vagrant most,</l>
<l>Adventure out into the common world</l>
<l>Of Man and Woman! thither lured by sight</l>
<l>Of some sweet human soul that blooms apart</l>
<l>Untainted by a rank soil's weedy growths;&#x2014;</l>
<l>Lured thither thus&#x2014;yet being, even then,</l>
<l>But wandering wildly, wilfully away</l>
<l>From its pure birth-place, whither it must return,</l>
<l>Or forfiet its celestial passport, ere</l>
<l>The dread night cometh." <add>Yet of how great worth</add></l>
<l><add>Is all foregone affection? In the spring</add></l>
<l><add>Of even the lowliest love, how many sweet</add></l>
<l><add>And beautiful things that would not else have been,</add></l>
<l><add>Grow up like flowers, and breathe a perfume forth</add></l>
<l><add>That never leaves the since it once hath hit,</add></l>
<l><add>However visionary seems at last</add></l>
<l><add>The charm through which it came."</add> <add>And having said</add></l>
<l><add>These mystical sentenses, so <del>sweet and wild</del> <add>wild and sweet</add>,</add></l>
<l><add>And memorably mournful,&#x2014;lo, her eyes</add></l>
<l>Ran o'er with lustres as they opened up</l>
<l>Under mine own now melancholy gaze.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">And so we stood, turned one unto the other,</l>
<l>Till love again grew glad<del>,</del> even from the rich</l>

<pb n="165" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/169"/>

<l>And wine-like luxury of its own free tears.</l>
<l>Forth then once more we looked&#x2014;silently happy.</l>
<l>Alas! not long: for with a short low gasp</l>
<l>Of sudden fear, she started; nor might <del>eye</del> I</l>
<l>Stand unalarmed. For hark! within the Tower</l>
<l>A sound of strenuous steps approaching fast</l>
<l>Rang upward, as it seemed, from the hard slabs</l>
<l>Of a steep winding stair; and soon the huge</l>
<l>And brazen portals that behind us shut</l>
<l>Burst open<del>!</del> with a clang of loosened bolts&#x2014;</l>
<l>A clang, like thunder, that went rattling out</l>
<l>Against the echoes of the distant hills.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">With deafened ears and looks aghast, I turned</l>
<l>Tow'rds the harsh noise,&#x2014;there to behold<del>,</del> between</l>
<l>The brazen jaunts in the tower-wall from which</l>
<l>The door swung inward, a tremendous Form!</l>
<l>A horrid gloomy Form<del>!<add>,</add></del> that shapeless seemed,</l>
<l>And yet in its so monstrous bulk, to Man</l>
<l>A hideous likeness <del>bore</del> <add>bare</add>! Still more and more</l>

<l>Its outlines, shadowing outward, so were lost</l>
<l>In <del>a</del> <add>one</add> dim undistinguishable haze,</l>
<l><del>That</del> <add>Which</add> hung around them<del>,</del> even as dull grey clouds</l>

<l>Beskirt a coming <del>Tempest</del> <add>Storm pitch[?]</add>, dark itself,</l>
<l>And murkiest in the midst&#x2014;yea, murkiest there,</l>

<l>The yet still spirit of the thunder broods,</l>
<l>And menaces the world.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="F">The Lady of Light</l>
<l>Had rushed to my extended arms and hid</l>
<l>Her beamy face, fright-harrowed, in my bosom!</l>
<l>And thus we stood, made one in fear; while still</l>
<l>That terrible Vision <del>out</del> <add>in</add> upon us glared</l>
<l>With horny eyes&#x2014;the horrider for that</l>
<l>No touch of passion vitalised their fixed</l>
<l>Eumenidean stone-cold stare, as tow'rds</l>
<l>Some surely destined task they seemed to guide</l>
<l>Its pitiless strength along.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="F">With one dark stride</l>
<l>Then glooming forward, and extending straight</l>
<l>One shadowy arm, from my reluctant grasp</l>
<l>It tore the Radiant Lady, muttering: This</l>
<l>Is love forbidden! in a voice whose tones</l>
<l>Were like low thunders ominously heard</l>
<l>Outroaming from the clouded gorges wild</l>

<l>Of neighboring mountains, when a <del>summer</del> <add>sultry</add> storm</l>
<l>Is brooding in its dark pavilions there,</l>
<l>And concentrating, like a mighty host,</l>
<l>Ere it <del>rush</del> <add>burst</add> vale-ward; and, as suddenly,</l>
<l>Siezed by the other, I was backward thrown</l>
<l>Within the Tower, and heard ere I could rise</l>
<l>From the cold platform, the huge brazen door</l>
<l>Drawn hoarsly grating to; its beam-like bar</l>
<l>Dropt, with a wall-quake, and <del>its</del> <add>the</add> bolts all shot</l>
<l>Into their sockets with a <del>thundrous</del> <add>shattering</add> jar!</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">I may not paint the horrible despair</l>
<l>That fro<del>s</del><add>z</add>e me now: (more horrible than aught</l>
<l>In actual destiny, whether bonds or death,</l>
<l>Could give the self-possession of my soul,</l>
<l>If wide awake.) I listened. All was still!</l>
<l>Within&#x2014;without&#x2014;all silent, stirless, cold.</l>
<l>What was my doom? And where was she, my late</l>
<l>So luminous delight? Gone! Reft away</l>
<l>So strangely&#x2014;terribly! and I myself,</l>
<l>For some all unimaginable cause,</l>
<l>A dungeoned wretch! Time, every drip of which</l>
<l>Was as an age, kept trickling on, but there</l>
<l>Brought no release&#x2014;no hope&#x2014;not even a breath</l>

<pb n="168" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/172"/>

<l>That spake of fellowship, or even of life,</l>
<l>Out of myself&#x2014;my lonely self! I stood</l>
<l>In marble-cold astonishment of heart,</l>
<l>Utterly blank. And when at length I cast</l>
<l>A desperate look&#x2014;so desperate, that the power</l>
<l>Of vision stung me like a deadly curse&#x2014;</l>
<l>Up and around, pure pity of myself</l>
<l>So warmed and loosened from my brain the pent</l>
<l>And icy anguish, that its load at once</l>
<l>Came, like an alp-thaw, streaming through mine eyes;</l>
<l>Till resignation, that so balmy sweet</l>
<l>Meek flower of grief <del>that</del> <add>which</add> hath its root in tears</l>
<l>Grew out of mine, and therewith, strength of will</l>
<l>To inspect my Prison.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="F">'Twas a lofty Cell,</l>
<l>Half round, and had within the granite wall</l>
<l>That cut the circle of its floor in twain,</l>
<l>A second door&#x2014;shut, and all clamped with brass</l>
<l>And rough with rows of monstrous iron studs,</l>
<l>And which migh[t] haply have thence opened in</l>
<l>Athward some stairway (as I guessed) that led</l>
<l>Down through the Tower; and by the side of this</l>
<l>A wing&#x00EB;d Steed upon four dragon claws&#x2014;</l>

<pb n="169" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/173"/>

<l>A strange, mute, mystic, almost terrible Thing,</l>
<l>Stood rigid, with a tripod near it placed.</l>
<l>Bare were the dull and rugged walls, but pierced</l>
<l>High out of reach by two small ports that looked</l>
<l>Eastward and westward.&#x2014;As I noted these</l>
<l>Full on my sight a transcient sunbeam fell</l>
<l>Slantingly through, and glowed on the damp floor,</l>
<l>A moment, like a streak of burning blood,</l>
<l>Then vanished; wherefore in my heart I guessed</l>
<l>That o'er the mountain tops the sun was then</l>
<l>Ocean-ward sinking.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="F">By degrees the night</l>
<l>Came on<del>,</del> and the Cell darkened: yea, I saw</l>
<l>The <del>Sted</del> Steed and tripod&#x2014;all its furniture,</l>
<l>Fade, melting gradually, more and more,</l>
<l>Into the darkness; even as a fish</l>
<l>Through the dense medium of its element</l>
<l>Retiring down, is in its outlines seen</l>
<l>More shadowy&#x2014;till 'tis lost. Then all was black.</l>
<l>And <del>two</del> to and fro I paced, hour after hour,</l>
<l>And heard my step, the only sound to me</l>
<l>In th' whole wide world, reverb with a dull blow</l>
<l>Down through the hollow Tower that seemed to yawn</l>

<pb n="170" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/174"/>

<l>Immeasurably beneath me,&#x2014;as it were</l>
<l>A monstrous well, whose wide waste mouth was</l>
<l type="F">bridged</l>
<l>By that <del>near-[?] hollow</del> <add>dull-</add>-quaking strip of floor alone</l>
<l>On which I darkling strode;&#x2014;yet on I kept</l>
<l>Pacing, though horrified. Hour after hour</l>
<l>Passed<del>,</del> as if clotting at the heart of Time&#x2014;</l>
<l>Each an eternity of expectation,</l>
<l>And weary <del>[unclear]</del> astonishment&#x2014;hour after hour!</l>
<l>And yet no other sound was living there,</l>
<l>Though, as I knew, one <emph><hi rend="ul">live</hi></emph> unmoving Thing</l>
<l>So near me stood in that blind solitude&#x2014;</l>
<l>Stood waiting&#x2014;wherefore? by the inner door.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">At last, all suddenly, in the air aloft,</l>
<l>O'er the Tower-roof, a wild, weird, wailful song</l>
<l>Woke fly<del>e</del><add>i</add>ng, many-voiced,&#x2014;then sweeping off,</l>
<l>Out tow'rds the echoey hills, so passed away</l>
<l>In dying murmurs through the hollow dark.</l></lg>

<lg>

<head>Song.</head>

<lg><l rend="indent1">So passed that song: (of which <add>the</add> drift alone</l>
<l>Is here reached after in such leaden speech</l>
<l>As uncharmed mortals use:) and when its tones</l>
<l>Out tow'rds the mountains in the dark afar</l>
<l>Had wasted, I grew sensible, methought,</l>
<l>Of seasonable change;&#x2014;that now the Cell</l>
<l>Kept clarifying, till the darkness seemed</l>
<l>Marbled with grey; and then the Steed again,</l>
<l>And tripod, figured indistinctly through</l>
<l><add>The</add> <del>T</del><add>t</add>hinning gloom, and gradually thence</l>
<l>Came forth in full developement, by the same</l>
<l>Degrees reversed in which they'd faded there</l>
<l>Into the darkness as the night came on.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">It was the Dawn: and thus it clearing kept,</l>
<l>Till through the eastern port a golden <del>[unclear]</del> rod</l>
<l>Of light fell transciently, and so bespake</l>
<l>The sunrise. Oh! it was a dessolate pass,</l>
<l>To feel,&#x2014;immured in that <del>so deadly place</del> <add>relentless <del>d[unclear] Tower</del> keep</add>,&#x2014;</l>
<l><del>That then the sun was</del> <add>How</add> on the purple hills <add>the sun was then</add></l>
<l>Rejoicing in his glory. Then to know</l>
<l>That he was wheeling up the heaven, and o'er</l>
<l>My Prison roof:&#x2014;hour after hour, to think</l>
<l>That he was tracking with a step of fire</l>

<pb n="173" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/177"/>

<l>His midway circle, and thence glorying down</l>
<l>Into the west. But this was my dread fate</l>
<l>While seven times day and night so came; and yet</l>
<l>I slept not! nor (to my amazement) there,</l>
<l>Through all this <del>weary woe, [unclear]</del> <add>drear time, did the</add> wintry <del>pinch</del> <add>tooth</add></l>
<l>Of hunger <del>shrink</del> <add>knaw within</add> my corporal life<add>!</add> <del>, no sense</del></l>
<l><del>Of</del> <add>No</add> thirst inflamed <add>me</add>! While <del>ever</del> by <del>the</del> <add>that grim</add> door</l>
<l>That seemed to shut athwart the stairway, stood</l>
<l><del>That</del> <add>Which</add> strange, unmoving, dragon-footed steed,</l>
<l>As from the first, and there the tripod, placed</l>
<l>As 'twere to aid some fugitive to mount</l>
<l>At once,&#x2014;and fly! Mere wonder at my doom,</l>
<l>So unimaginably wild and vague,</l>
<l>Relieved despair.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="F">But on the seventh night&#x2014;hark!</l>
<l>What might I hear?&#x2014;a step?&#x2014;a light small step</l>
<l><del>Ascending by the stair! Swiftly it</del> <add>That by the stair ascending, swiftly</add> came</l>
<l>Straight to the inner door&#x2014;then stopt. Alas!</l>
<l>The black valve opened not; and yet, the while,</l>
<l>In evidence of some bright <del>Presence, there</del> <add>Influence</add></l>
<l>Standing without, a rainbow radiance through</l>
<l>Its solid breadth, in <del>[unclear]</del> <add>subtle</add> wave on <del>[unclear]t</del> wave</l>
<l>Came flushing, even as a sunset glow</l>

<pb n="174" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/178"/>

<l>Through some dense cloud upon the verge of heaven</l>
<l><add>In swift rich curves wells percolating forth&#x2014;</add></l>
<l><del>Comes percolating</del> <add>So came it</add>,&#x2014;filling all the Cell at length</l>
<l>With rosy lights that in the darkness fumed</l>
<l>Like luminous odors; at the scent of which</l>
<l>The mystic Steed, so rigid until now,</l>
<l>Moved, and spread wide his glimmering wings. When, hark!</l>
<l>Another step? Yea, the same strenuous tramp</l>
<l>That once before I'd heard big-beating up,</l>
<l>Came following&#x2014;till a low sad cry without</l>
<l>Went to my heart, and I might hear ensue</l>
<l>A struggle as of one forced down the stair</l>
<l>By that so ruthless Guard!&#x2014;down, till the Cell</l>
<l>Again had darkened, and the Tower itself</l>
<l>Stood once more as in some mute void of Time,</l>
<l>Or depth of distance infinitely out,</l>
<l>Achingly still. But not for long! again</l>
<l>The Monster's hateful tread came booming up,</l>
<l>Quake <del>[unclear]</del> <add>above</add> quake that with a shudder stopt</l>
<l>Dead at the door! It opened; and he stood</l>
<l>Full in <del>its</del> <add>the</add> dubious space:&#x2014;but ere the Fiend</l>
<l>Might enter farther, rage and hate at once</l>
<l>Possessed me, and I charged him! For awhile</l>
<l>His horrible glooms voluminously vague,</l>
<l>Yet with a smothering pressure in their folds,</l>

<pb n="175" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h642/h642d/179"/>

<l>Involved me,&#x2014;concentrating more and more,</l>
<l>And lapping closer in yet denser coils,</l>
<l>Each moment!&#x2014;but my loathing now had grown</l>
<l>Into so vast a horror, that, methought,</l>
<l>I burst with irresistible strength away!</l>
<l>Rushed through the door, and down the stairway,&#x2014;down</l>
<l>An endless depth; till a portcullis, hinged</l>
<l>In the Tower's basement, opened to my flight!</l>
<l>No sooner had I passed it than it fell</l>
<l>In thunder to! and thence my passage lay</l>
<l>Along the difficult ledges of a rock</l>
<l>Bordering the Lake.&#x2014;</l></lg>

<lg><l type="F">And when at last I paused</l>
<l>In that so giddy flight, methought I saw</l>
<l>The lustrous Lady up through the lit air</l>
<l>Ascending, with a steadfast downward look</l>
<l>Of parting recognition,&#x2014;full of love,</l>
<l>But painless, passionless. Upward she passed,</l>
<l>Above the Tower, and o'er the clouds,&#x2014;and when</l>
<l>Her radiance melted through heaven's marble dome,</l>
<l>And left it vacant in its <del>world-like</del> <add>infinite</add> vastness,</l>

<l>Awoke to find it but a Dream of Wonder:</l>
<l>Yet ever since to feel as if some pure</l>
<l>And guardian Soul, out of the day and night,</l>
<l>Had passed for ever from the reach of Love.</l>
<l>Albeit I know, that to the Poet's mind</l>
<l>No light, no loveliness it once hath know,</l>
<l>Though only through the mystery of a dream,</l>
<l>Is after lost; but in effect remains</l>
